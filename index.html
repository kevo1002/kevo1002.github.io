				My Name is Kevin Hamilton and I am a native of Northern Virginia.  I currently reside in Washington D.C., in the DuPont Circle area and am loving the city life!  
				<br><br>
				I am currently enrolled in George Washington University's coding bootcamp program and am hoping to become a webdeveloper upon completion.  Prior to this I studied at George Mason University and receieved my bachelor of science degree from their Business School in Information Systems Operations Management.  That degree gave me exposure to technical proficiencies and gave me the soft skills to become successful in a business environment.
				<br><br>
				Along with completing my degree I have held two different internships.  The first was as a genereal business summer intern for Van Ness Feldman (an enviromental policy law firm).  The second internship was at National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) as a communications/development intern.  Although both of these internships did not require hard technical skills, they did provide the soft skills needed to navigate a professional environment.  I enjoyed my time at both companies but want to continue my education and gain the technical hard skills to join the workforce as a web developer.
